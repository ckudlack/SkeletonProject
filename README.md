# Sample Project

This branch contains a simple app that will allow you to search for a user on SoundCloud, and then view the artists they follow.

Part 2, as yet unfinished, will use the SongKick api to find events for those artists in your area

## TODO:
- Add pagination for followings list
- Get SongKick API key access (waiting to hear back from them)
